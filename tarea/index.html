	<h2>What It's Really Like to Be a Female Photographer</h2><br>
		<p>When I first started to pursue photography as a career in Atlanta, I didn't notice many differences as a woman. That all changed when I moved to Louisville, Kentucky, a city with a drastically smaller arts industry than I had become accustomed to. Ironically, it was the man that I relocated to work for, Clay Cook, who taught me the most about the adversity I was going to face as a woman in this industry and what it would take for me to plow through it. During a crew lunch following one of my first shoots with Clay we chatted about our weaknesses and goals.<br><br> My memory isn't the best but I will never forget the words he spoke to me that day. Like every day working with Clay, I learned a lot, but it was one simple sentence that I am reminded of all too often today. With the utmost seriousness, he looked at me and said, "It”s going to be really hard for you as a woman Gabi.” No one could have prepared me for the year to follow that would prove just how right he was that day.</p><p><a href="https://fstoppers.com/bts/what-its-really-be-female-photographer-199023">Read more</a></p>

			<h2>Things to Consider When Choosing the Best Lens for Portraits.</h2>
			<p>Zoom vs. Prime Lenses – Before we get into the different features to look for in lenses for portrait photography, let’s talk about the two major types of lenses: zooms and primes. Zoom lenses come in a variety of focal ranges (such as 24-70mm, 70-200mm, etc.), making each lens extremely versatile. Zoom lenses make it easy for you to take a wide variety of photos without ever having to switch out your gear. Prime lenses have fixed focal lengths (24mm, 35mm, 50mm, etc.) and provide superior clarity and image quality. What they may lack in versatility they make up for in performance. They are also typically smaller and lighter to carry around than a zoom lens. Many professional portrait photographers prefer primes due to the sharp, beautiful images they create. For even more convincing, see Prime Lens Basics and Why You Should Ditch Zoom Lens Photography.<br><br>Focal Length – One of the first things you will need to decide is what focal length is right for your needs. The best focal length for portrait photography depends on many things, including the available space where you will be shooting, the number of people in the frame, how much of the nearby environment you want to include, and how close you want to be to your subjects. Focal lengths from 35mm to 200mm are common for portrait photography, depending on the subject, style, and preferences of the photographer.<br><br>Number of Lenses You Want to Carry – If you only want to carry around one lens, you may want to look for a zoom. Zoom lenses will give you a lot of options when it comes to focal lengths. A lens like a 24-105mm will let you take a large variety of photos without ever swapping lenses. If you plan to shoot primes and want to use various focal lengths, you will have to carry multiple lenses. Many professional photographers get around having to constantly swap out prime lenses by using two camera bodies with different focal length primes mounted to the front.</p>

	<h2> Essential Black and White Photography Tips</h2>
			<p>Black and white is nothing new when it comes to art; it’s existed since the beginning of time.Art photography is similar in that it started out in black and white due to technical limitations—well before the dawn of colour film.<br>Even though the majority of photography is done automatically on digital cameras, black and white photography lives on, remaining a very powerful technique. Colour photography is the strongest when trying to accurately reproduce a scene because it captures the full spectrum of colour present.<br>Black and white photography shy’s away from accurate reproduction, focusing on other visual effects such as tone, texture and shape.The difficulty is deciding which one takes precedence in a photo—colour vs. black and white—and how you capture it.<br><br>
			Tips: Shoot in Colour.Shooting in colour allows you to capture the light in three different channels: red, blue, and green.When it comes to processing the images, manipulating these colours in different ways allows you to create different effects: boosting the red filter has the effect of a darker, more dramatic sky; the blue filter increases the atmospheric haze; and the green filter darkens skin tones.These are just a few things that change. I recommend learning by doing; have a play around with some of your own photos.<br><br>
			ISO No Longer Matters: A high ISO produces a lot of grain in an image which looks especially bad in brown area of colour photos.Black and white however is reminiscent of old film photography which was quite grainy, so it fits in better. A high ISO also adds the texture that your photo is lacking—something black and white does very well.</p>
