	<h2>What It's Really Like to Be a Female Photographer</h2><br>
		<p>When I first started to pursue photography as a career in Atlanta, I didn't notice many differences as a woman. That all changed when I moved to Louisville, Kentucky, a city with a drastically smaller arts industry than I had become accustomed to. Ironically, it was the man that I relocated to work for, Clay Cook, who taught me the most about the adversity I was going to face as a woman in this industry and what it would take for me to plow through it. During a crew lunch following one of my first shoots with Clay we chatted about our weaknesses and goals.<br><br> My memory isn't the best but I will never forget the words he spoke to me that day. Like every day working with Clay, I learned a lot, but it was one simple sentence that I am reminded of all too often today. With the utmost seriousness, he looked at me and said, "It”s going to be really hard for you as a woman Gabi.” No one could have prepared me for the year to follow that would prove just how right he was that day.</p><p><a href="https://fstoppers.com/bts/what-its-really-be-female-photographer-199023">Read more</a></p>

<h2>Planning and Executing Your First Photo Editorial</h2><br>
			<p>The in-between stages of fashion photography can be knowing which ideas for stories serve best as test shoots and which are worth pushing forward as a full editorial. Do the benefits of a cohesive editorial outweigh the efforts required to make it? This article breaks down the steps required from idea to execution.<br><br>
			Test Shoot Versus Editorial: Test shoots are mainly done as a means to create solid content for both your portfolio and the models involved. Test shoots, however, can be simply for that — to test out a new idea, equipment, or model before booking them for something more substantial. This is the time where you ask yourself is this newfound idea one that would serve best in a portfolio or as webitorial/editorial. I say this because there has been times where I really want to push for an editorial on an idea that is not cohesive enough to build a story on or thought out enough.<br><br>
Get to Know Your Magazine:Get to know the audience of the magazine you ultimately want to shoot and submit for, as that will dictate what stories you approach them with. This can be done by doing a quick investigation of their websites and social media outlets. I wouldn't approach an edgy or dark magazine with something light and airy if it completely misses their usual aesthetic. So get to know them as far as what they are looking for story wise as well as submission policies and deadlines. Some magazines would prefer more times than not that you shoot for the upcoming season, so by the time the story is released it is cohesive and keeps up with the current trends.</p><p><a href="https://fstoppers.com/education/planning-and-executing-your-first-photo-editorial-222159">Read more</a></p>
